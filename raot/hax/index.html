You'll need to install Cheat Engine. Their official site looks sketch as hell so I've taken the liberty of making this direct download link. Download it if you trust me.
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rqmaot/hax/releases/download/cheat-engine/CheatEngine74.exe" download>Download Cheat Engine 7.4</a>
<br>
Windows will detect it as a virus so when you install you need to go into Virus & Threat Protection to tell Windows to allow it. You can also disable virus scanning altogether but that's not recommended.
<br>
Once you have it running you need to get it attached to raot, if you press the magnifying glass on monitor icon (top left) you should find raot.exe and double click that.
<br>
If you just want to speedhack, CE does it for you. There's a checkbox on the right side of the screen to enable speedhacks. Put in how fast you want to go and apply (warning: speedhack increases ping and makes the connection more unstable)
<br>
If you want Mala's beautiful hacks you can download this script and open it in CE:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/rqmaot/hax/releases/download/scriptv1.1/raot.CT" download>Mala's scripts</a>
<br>
Mala's genius hacks include infinite/no gas, no stress, teleporting (at this time you need to edit the scripts to hardcode in the coords), and infinite swords (these are buggy and if you have them on when respawning you won't be able to throw, and you also need to have at least one sword in reserve ammo when you activate it)
